# Attention-Augmented-CNN-For-INS-ID
Files for creating a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Augmented with Attention 

The AttentionAugmentedConvLayer file holds the keras code to create an attention augmented convolution layer. A sample usage of it can be seen in the Network builder file.

InsIDNetworkBuilder file contains a function which returns a DCNN model augmented with attention. The function has multiple settings to freely change how the model is constructed.
